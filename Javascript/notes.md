# History of JavaScript

## 1. Introduction

### Step 01. Understand the context of JavaScript's Creation

- Year to Remeber: 1990 marks the dawn of internet (creation of world wide web)
- Company Needs: Companies wanted to share information online, leading to creation of websites
- Static Websites: Initially, websites were static, created by HTML authors using HTML and CSS.

### Step 02. Emergence of Browsers

- Browsers: Browsers are software applications designed to access and display the contents of the World Wide Web.
- 1993: Mosaic browser was developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. 
- Mosaic browser gained popularity, prompting companies to develop their own browsers.
- Netscape's Creation: Mosaic's developers, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark, founded Netscape Communications and Introduced the Netscape Navigator browser in 1994.
- Microsoft's Response: Created Internet Explorer; offered it for free as part of Windows OS.

### Step 03. The need of interactivity

- Netscape's Challenge : As Netscape navigator gained market share, the company recognised the need to add interactive features to compete with internet explorer.
- Java's Influence : Netscape initially explored using java applets to introduce interactivity on web pages, but the integration and performance issue let them to explore creating a new client-side scripting language.

### Step 04. The Birth of JavaScript

- Brendan Eich's Hiring : Netscape hired Brendan Eich, a skilled programmer, to create a new language that could add interactivity to web pages.
- Rapid Development : Eich developed the new language, originally called Mocha, in just 10 days.
- Name Changes : The language went through several name changes, from Mocha to LiveScript, and finally JavaScript, to leverage the popularity of Java and capitalize on its brand recognition.
- Launch : JavaScript was introduced in 1995 with the release of Netscape Navigator 2.

# Step 05. Introduction to JScript

- Microsoft's Strategy : Seeing the success of JavaScript in Netscape Navigator, Microsoft reverse-engineered the language and created its own version called JScript.
- Browser Compatibility : JavaScript was primarily used on Netscape Navigator, while JScript was the competing language used on Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

# Step 06. Different Implementations and Inconsistencies

- Different Versions : Browsers like Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Firfox and others began developing their own JavaScript engines. Notably, Internet Explorer, introduced Jscript.
- Inconsistencies : A script that worked correctly on Netscape Navigator might not funtion correctly on Internet Explorer due to different syntax or functionality.
- Impact on Developers : Developers were forced to write multiple versions of same code which led to increased development time and decreased the redability of web applications.

### Step 07. Standardization Efforts

- Netscape approached European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) due to the need of the uniform standard and the desire for a collaborative environment for developing the language.
- ECMA : ECMA provides a platform for collaboration among various stakeholders, including manufacturers, vendors, developers and corporate representatives. This inclusivity helps to create a balanced standard that reflects the interests and needs of all parties.
- How ECMA Helped : Microsoft or other vendors were not "forced" to stop using JScript or other JavaScript variants. Instead, the goal was to establish a common ground that all vendors, including Microsoft could work towards.
- What ECMA wants them to do: ECMA provided a framework called ECMAScript. According to this framework, all vendors could keep their unique enhancements(like Microsoft's JScript) while adhering the common elements defined by ECMAScript.
- Transition towards compliance : Microsoft, along with other vendors, was encouraged to align its implementation of JavaScript with ECMAScript standard.
- ECMAScript : The first standard, called ECMAScript, was released in 1997.
- Over Time Acceptance : Over Time Microsoft and other browser vendors began to support the ECMAScript standards in their products.

### Step 08. The Dot-Com Bubble Burst

- Dot-com : "dot-com" refers to internet-based companies that emerged during the late 1990s, characterized by their ".com" domain names.
- Dot-com Bubble Burst : The dot-com bubble burst was a significant market collapse in early 2000s, categorised by rapid decline of internet-based companies.
- Struggle of Netscape and Acquisition : The dot-com bubble burst had a profound impact on Netscape, the burst led Netscape to struggle in maintaining its market position, facing intense competition from other browsers like internet explorer, and ultimately leading to its decline and eventual acquisition by AOL(Americal Online) in 1999.
- Creation of Firefox : Before aquisition Netscape had already begun the discussions about open-sourcing its browser. However, after the aquisition AOL supported the decision to release the source code of Netscape's browser to stimulate development and innovation. This move led to the groundwork for the Mozilla project, which then led to the creation of firefox.

### Step 09. Evolution of JavaScript

- Post-Bubble Stagnation : After the dot-com bubble burst, JavaScript development stagnated, with new features and improvements being delayed.
- 2005 - AJAX : The introduction of AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology revolutionized how web applications interacted with the server, leading to more dynamic and responsive wev experiences.

### Step 10. Advancements and Node.js

- Engine Improvements : In the late 2000s, Google introduced the V8 JavaScript engine, which significantly improved the execution speed of JavaScript, paving the way for more advanced applications.
- Node.js : Developed in 2009, Node.js allowed JavaScript to be used outside of the browser, enabling developers to build server-side applications and various other types of software using JavaScript.

### Step 11. ECMAScript Version Updates

- ECMAScript 5 : Released in 2009, ECMAScript 5 introduced several modern features and improvements to the language, further enhancing its capabilities.
- ECMAScript 6 (2015) : Regarded as a significant milestone, ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES2015) set a new benchmark for JavaScript, with numerous new features and syntax improvements.
- Annual Releases : Since 2016, ECMAScript versions have been released annualy, with each new version bringing additional features and enhancements to the language.

### Step 12. Compatibility and Current Standings

- Backward Compatibility : JavaScript has maintained a high degree of backward compatibility, allowing older code to continue running in modern browsers.
- Forward Compatibility : However, JavaScript is not always forward-compatible, as newer versions can introduce breaking changes that may require code updates. 
- Current Status : JavaScript has become the predominant language for web development, with a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. It has also expanded beyond the browser, with its use in server-side development, mobile applications, and even internet of Things(IOT) projects.
