# JavaScript

## Introduction

- JavaScript is a programming language that allows us to make websites interactive and dynamic. It lets us add features like animations, form validation, and real-time updates without needing to refresh the page.
- In simple terms, JavaScript makes web pages come to life.
- JavaScript is also referred to as a scripting language
- A scripting language is a programming language that is interpreted rather than compiled.
- JavaScript is executed by web browsers, which interpret the code at runtime rather than compiling it ahead of time.This allows for dynamic execution and immediate feedback in the development process.

## Client-Side v/s Server-Side JavaScript

### Client-Side JavaScript

- Client-side JavaScript is executed on user's web browser. It runs on the client (user's device) rather than on server.
- It foucuses on user interactivity and DOM manipulation.

### Server-Side JavaScript

- Server-side JavaScript is executed on the server. It runs on the server's environment like (Node.js) and is responsible for handling requests from clients (web browsers).
- It handles business logic, database interaction, and API management.

### Interaction between Client-Side and Server-Side JavaScript

#### In a typical web application

- A client-side scipt might make an AJAX request to the server to fetch data.
- The server processes the request, interacts with a database if necessary, and sends back a response.
- The client-side script then updates the web page dynamically based on the received data.


## Frameworks

### Frameworks

- Frameworks are pre-written sets of code that provide a structure and foundation for developers to build applications efficiently.

### Types of JavaScript Frameworks

- JavaScript frameworks are of two types - 1. Client-side (Front-end) frameworks, 2. Server-side (Back-end) frameworks

#### Client-side (Front-end) frameworks

- Popular Client-side (Front-end) frameworks are - 
- React.js
- Angular.js
- Vue.js

#### Server-side (Back-end) frameworks

- Popular Server-side (Back-end) frameworks are - 
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Koa.js
- Hapi.js


## Applications of JavaScript

- JavaScript is not just for web apps. It's also used in mobile apps, desktop apps, and even game development.

## Difference between Java and JavaScript

- Java is a statically typed (refers to the fixed nature of variable types once they are declared), object-oriented programming language.
- While JavaScript is dynamically typed (refers to the variable and flexible nature of type assignment during the execution of the program), interpreted language that supports multiple programming styles (functional, object-oriented, imperative).

- Java runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows it to be platform independent.
- While JavaScript is primarily executed in web browsers and is also used on the server side (with environments like Node.js).

- Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM.
- JavaScript code is executed directly by the interpreter in the browser (or Node.js).
